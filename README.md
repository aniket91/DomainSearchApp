3. Download tomcat runtime
4. Copy war file(DomainSearchApp.war) from target folder to webapps of tomcat installation dir

## Few important files -
1. pom.xml - Has all maven dependencies required by the project like spring, gson etc
2. WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml - Web application configuration goes here
3. WebContent/WEB-INF/domainsearcher-servlet.xml - Dispacher servlet configuration goes here
4. WebContent/WEB-INF/JSP/search.jsp - Single jsp page with text field that supports auto complete
5. src/com/domainsearch/controller/SearchDomain.java - controller for spring application
6. src/com/domainsearch/index/DomainIndexer.java - Indexer service that interacts between controller and actual index impl
7. src/com/domainsearch/index/Trie.java - Actual indexing implementation
8. src/top-1m.csv - domains data set


## Other Notes
1. Project needs to be deployed on a tomcat container
2. Project uses Java/JSP/Jquery/Javascript/HTML 

## Known limitations
1. Indexing implementation does not handle all chars. It just handles chars/numbers and a .
2. API to fetch matched domain results is not authenticated
